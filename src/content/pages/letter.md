Re: Mandatory Developer Registration for Android App Distribution
```

* * *

We, the undersigned organizations representing civil society, nonprofit institutions, and technology companies, write to express our strong opposition to Google's announced policy requiring all Android app developers to register centrally with Google in order to distribute applications outside of the Google Play Store, set to take effect worldwide in the coming months.

While we do recognize the importance of platform security and user safety, the Android platform already includes multiple security mechanisms that do not require central registration. Forcibly injecting an alien security model that runs counter to Android's historic open nature threatens innovation, competition, privacy, and user freedom. We implore Google to withdraw this policy and work with the open-source and security communities on less restrictive alternatives.

## Our Concerns

**1\. Gatekeeping Beyond Google's Own Store**

Android has historically been characterized as an open platform where users and developers can operate independently of Google's services. The proposed developer registration policy fundamentally alters that relationship by requiring developers who wish to distribute apps through alternative channels — their own websites, third-party app stores, enterprise distribution systems, or direct transfers — to first seek permission from Google through a mandatory verification process, which involves the agreement to Google's terms and conditions, the payment of a fee, and the uploading of government-issued identification.

This extends Google's gatekeeping authority beyond its own marketplace into distribution channels where it has no legitimate operational role. Developers who choose not to use Google's services should not be forced to register with, and potentially be judged by, Google. This also gives Google newfound powers to completely disable any app it wants to, for any reason, for the entire Android ecosystem.

**2\. Barriers to Entry and Innovation**

Mandatory registration creates friction and barriers to entry, particularly for:  

*   Individual developers and small teams with limited resources
*   Open-source projects that rely on volunteer contributors
*   Developers in regions with limited access to Google's registration infrastructure
*   Privacy-focused developers who avoid surveillance ecosystems
*   Emergency response and humanitarian organizations requiring rapid deployment
*   Activists working on internet freedom in countries that unjustly criminalize that work
*   Developers in countries or regions where Google cannot allow them to sign up due to sanctions
*   Researchers and academics developing experimental applications
*   Internal enterprise and government applications never intended for broad public distribution

Every additional bureaucratic hurdle reduces diversity in the software ecosystem and concentrates power in the hands of large, established players who can more easily absorb such compliance costs.

**3\. Privacy and Surveillance Concerns**  

Requiring registration with Google creates a comprehensive database of all Android developers, regardless of whether or not they use Google's services. This raises serious questions about:

*   What personal information developers must provide
*   How this information will be stored, secured, and used
*   Whether this data could be subject to government requests or legal processes
*   The potential for tracking developer activity across the ecosystem
*   The implications for developers working on privacy-preserving or politically sensitive applications

Developers should have the right to create and distribute software without submitting to unnecessary surveillance or scrutiny.

**4\. Arbitrary Enforcement and Account Termination Risks**

Google's existing app review processes have been criticized for opaque decision-making, inconsistent enforcement, and limited appeal mechanisms. Extending this system to all Android certified devices creates risks of:

*   Arbitrary rejection or suspension without clear justification
*   Automated systems making consequential decisions with insufficient human oversight
*   Developers losing their ability to distribute apps across all channels due to a single un-reviewable corporate decision
*   Political or competitive considerations influencing registration approvals
*   Disproportionate impact on marginalized communities and controversial but legal applications

A single point of failure controlled by one corporation is antithetical to a healthy, competitive software ecosystem.

**5\. Anticompetitive Implications**

This requirement allows Google to collect intelligence on all Android development activity, including:

*   Which apps are being developed and by whom  
*   Alternative distribution strategies and business models
*   Competitive threats to Google's own services
*   Market trends and user preferences outside of Google's ecosystem

This information asymmetry provides Google with significant competitive advantages and may allow it to preempt, copy, or undermine competing products and services, and opens many questions about antitrust.

**6\. Regulatory concerns**  

Regulatory authorities worldwide, including the European Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, and competition authorities in multiple jurisdictions, have increasingly scrutinized dominant platforms' ability to preference their own services and restrict competition, demanding more openness and interoperability. We also acknowledge the growing concern on regulatory intervention increasing mass surveillance, impeding software freedom, open internet and device neutrality.

We urge Google to find alternative ways to comply with regulatory obligations by promoting models that respect Android's open nature without increasing gatekeeper control over the platform.

## Existing Measures Are Sufficient  

The Android platform already includes multiple security mechanisms that do not require central registration:

*   Operating system-level security features, application sandboxing, and permission systems
*   User warnings for applications that are directly installed (or "sideloaded")
*   Google Play Protect (which users can choose to enable or disable)
*   Developer signing certificates that establish software provenance

No evidence has been presented that these safeguards are insufficient to continue to protect Android users as they have for the past seventeen years of Android's existence. If Google's concern is genuinely about security rather than control, it should invest in improving these existing mechanisms rather than creating new bottlenecks and centralizing control.

## Our Request

We call on Google to:

1.  **Immediately rescind** the mandatory developer registration requirement for third-party distribution
2.  **Engage in transparent dialogue** with civil society, developers, and regulators about Android security improvements that respect openness and competition
3.  **Commit to platform neutrality** by ensuring that Android remains a genuinely open platform where Google's role as platform provider does not conflict with its commercial interests

The strength of the Android ecosystem has always been its openness, and Google has always been a faithful steward of that trust. Policies that centralize control, create unnecessary barriers, and extend gatekeeping authority beyond a single marketplace threaten the innovation, diversity, and freedom that have made Android successful.

We urge Google to reconsider this policy and to work collaboratively with the broader community to advance security objectives without sacrificing the open principles upon which Android was built.
